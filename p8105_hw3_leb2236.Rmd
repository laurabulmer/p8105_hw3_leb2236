## Problem 1

```{r loading dataset}
data("ny_noaa")
```

## Problem 2

## Delete this code
```{r}
part_testing = read_csv(file = "./data/nhanes_covar.csv")
```

First, the below code is used to load and tidy the datasets related to accelerometers and the participants. 

```{r load and tidy participants}
participants = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/nhanes_covar.csv", 
           skip = 4,
           na = c(".", "NA", ""),
           col_types = cols(
             'SEQN' = col_character(),
             'sex' = col_factor(),
             'age' = col_integer(),
             'BMI' = col_double(),
             'education' = col_factor()
           ))

participants = janitor::clean_names(participants)
```


```{r load and tidy accelerometer}
accelerometer = read_csv(file = "./data/nhanes_accel.csv",
                         na = c(".", "NA", ""),
                         col_types = cols(
                           'SEQN' = col_character()
                         )
                         )
accelerometer = janitor::clean_names(accelerometer)
```

Next I am sub-setting participants data to drop missing observations and exclude participants less than 21.

```{r }
participants_clean = participants %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  filter(age > 20)
```

Next, I am joining my two datasets. 

```{r}
accel_df = left_join(participants_clean, accelerometer, by = 'seqn')
```

Next I am creating a table for the number of men and women in each education category.

```{r}
accel_df %>%
  mutate(
    sex = recode(sex, `1` = "Male", `2` = "Female"),
    education = recode(education, 
                       `1` = "Less than High School", 
                       `2` = "High School Equivalent", 
                       `3` = "More than High School")
    )%>%
group_by(education, sex) %>%
  summarize(count_sex = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = education,
    values_from = count_sex
  )%>%
knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
accel_df %>%
  mutate(
    sex = recode(sex, `1` = "Male", `2` = "Female"),
    education = recode(education, 
                       `1` = "Less than High School", 
                       `2` = "High School Equivalent", 
                       `3` = "More than High School")
    )%>%
group_by(education, sex) %>%
  summarize(count_education = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = count_education
  )%>%
knitr::kable()
```
